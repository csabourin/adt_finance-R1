00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:07.750
In general, no invoice should be paid until

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.959
all goods are received or services performed.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:20.291
Exercising your certification authority under section 34

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.625
of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:24.750
essentially means that you pause

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.917
to attest that the goods and services you received

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:29.625
match the invoice.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.959
While other people on your team may be able to make that assessment,

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:36.333
it is you, as the delegated manager,

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.083
who bears the weight of the accountability.

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:40.959
As such, you need to make sure that

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:43.834
the invoice is accurate – and that the financial coding

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:45.875
is also accurate.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.458
Of course, you can only do this if

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:50.667
you have the proper authority to make that assessment.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.875
So be sure to check that too!

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.083
Before signing off on an invoice,

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:03.041
the manager, usually with the help of their administrative staff,

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:08.250
verifies the accuracy of an invoice or claim by looking at the following elements:

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.417
The date issued – verify that the invoice was issued

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:15.417
on or after the order date; or, in the case of a contract,

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:18.250
that it was issued during the contract period.

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:22.000
Quantities – confirm that the items

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.166
claimed line up with the items ordered.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:29.417
Taxes – validate that the amount for taxes is accurate

00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:33.166
and has appropriate GST or PST numbers.

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.583
Supplier or payee –

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:37.709
make sure that their information is accurate

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.250
and that the supplier or payee is eligible for payment.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:45.792
And status – verify that the invoice has not already been paid.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.500
You may need to go back to the supplier to correct the invoice

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.792
before you can sign section 34.

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.417
Invoices must be paid within 30 days

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:57.834
from the time the department receives the invoice

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:00.500
to avoid interest charges.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.500
Once the invoice is validated,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.333
the manager verifies the financial coding

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.083
and approves section 34.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:16.208
This approval is done with a signature either on paper

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:20.000
or electronically, depending on the practices in your department.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.625
The approved invoice is then sent to the Finance unit,

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:27.417
who will pay the invoice pursuant to section 33.

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:31.792
Keep in mind: you are not allowed to authorize sections 33 and 34

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:34.166
for the same transaction or invoice;

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:37.583
a financial officer will perform section 33.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:42.500
You are not allowed to authorize section 41 for a contract

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.667
and section 34 related to the same contract;

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.959
a procurement officer will perform section 41.

00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:52.250
You are not allowed to authorize any transaction

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.041
for which you may be perceived as having a personal benefit.
