00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:13.333
A financial situation report, or FSR,

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.417
is a document that provides senior management with the most

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:18.375
up-to-date financial picture

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.792
and the best estimates of forecast spending.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.542
This document supports them in making informed decisions

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:28.959
to properly address budget shortfalls or pressures

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:31.834
and reallocate surpluses.

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:35.208
Your department may have a different name for this report.

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:36.750
Find out what that is.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.834
As a manager, you are expected to provide regular updates

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:45.000
and forecasts for your responsibility centre

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.333
throughout the year.

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:50.750
You are also required to provide explanations on variances

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.500
in order to provide accurate information

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.959
and make sure the financial system is updated.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.625
But don’t worry, you won’t be doing this alone!

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.959
This is usually led by your organization’s

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.792
Finance section at specific times in the year.

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:09.125
They will provide support and send out instructions

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:11.458
to provide templates, guidelines,

00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:13.667
links, due dates, etc.

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.959
Work with your administrative staff to complete these tasks.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.291
Let’s see what you already know about FSRs by doing a quick match-up game!

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:30.041
The fiscal year starts on April 1

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:33.375
and is divided by month, into periods.

00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:38.250
P1 is April, P2 is May, P3 is June, and so forth.

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:42.417
Typically, key reporting periods are P6 (September),

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:44.583
P9 (December),

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:48.001
and a year-end report in P12 (March).

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.333
Because P6 (September) is midway through the year,

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.959
it offers senior management a good picture of the organization's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:02.667
finances and allows them to make decisions that will influence year-end results.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:08.041
For example, they could decide to reallocate funds to different priorities.

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:13.750
P9 (December) is often the last opportunity to influence year-end results.

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:18.333
Departments may ask managers to provide a forecast in P9

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:22.375
that is within a certain percentage of the year-end amount.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:26.750
The Treasury Board Secretariat uses data from the P9 report

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.083
to inform the Department of Finance

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:31.750
of government-wide planned spending

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.125
so that they have a holistic view.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:36.417
Year-end data at P12

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:41.001
is used by your department to report their overall financial results.

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:45.709
It also forms part of the Departmental Results Report, or DRR.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.458
The most important information you will need to provide in the

00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:57.291
FSR is your forecast.

00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:58.959
In other words, you’ll need to estimate the

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.458
amount of money that you are going to spend

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:05.291
to complete your activities before the end of the fiscal year.

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:08.542
You can request that your administrative professional pull

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:11.041
a detailed financial report from

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.917
the financial system

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:17.375
with information on the budget, commitments and actual expenditures.

00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:20.500
You will compare this to the FSR.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:25.041
Here are some of the things you can do to get a good sense of where you’re at,

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:29.083
which will allow you to make solid estimates for the rest of the year:

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:33.166
Ensure that salary forecasts are accurate and up to date.

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:37.458
Account for any incoming or outgoing funding.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:41.625
Follow up on travel claims and outstanding invoices.

00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:44.667
Ensure journal vouchers are posted,

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.875
this will correct the data in the financial system.

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.709
Close commitments that are no longer required,

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.959
and reconcile your acquisition card statement against commitments.

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:58.500
Now, answer the following questions to the best of your abilities

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.500
and let’s practise preparing a financial situation report!

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:10.333
Another important task when completing your FSR

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:14.583
is to review your salary and O&amp;M forecasts.

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:18.083
This will allow you to identify shortfalls and pressures that

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:21.250
may require approval for additional resources.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:25.625
Or surpluses to signal potential carry forward amounts.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:28.834
You will have to explain the reasons for any variances

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:32.125
and provide mitigation strategies for risks.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:35.709
 Let’s practise updating the Annual Forecast!
