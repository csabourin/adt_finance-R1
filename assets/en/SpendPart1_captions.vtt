00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:06.250
Now that you have your approved budget

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.750
and are beginning to deliver on your work plan,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.792
let’s start spending money!

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:18.542
But before initiating and committing any expenditures,

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:22.375
you must verify that there are sufficient funds in your budget.

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:26.542
This means you need to review what has been spent or committed to date,

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:29.500
along with any other planned expenditures.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.834
As the year progresses, you will most likely

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:35.041
shuffle unused amounts within your budgeted items

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.667
to find the funds you need for expenditures.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:43.041
Don’t forget! The format of your budget may differ from the one used here,

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:45.834
depending on where you work.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.333
Did you know that financial authorities are

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.959
granted to ministers and deputy heads

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:59.000
through the Financial Administration Act, the FAA?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.959
These individuals then delegate authority to positions

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.959
identified by title

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:08.583
through their organization’s delegation of financial signing authorities chart.

00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:14.208
To exercise your financial authority, you need to do the following three things:

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:17.458
One, successfully complete this course.

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:22.291
Two, submit your signed delegation card to your Finance unit.

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:25.417
And three, receive your formal delegation of authority

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.291
in writing from your Finance unit.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:33.917
There are several delegated authorities, and managers typically have two.

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:37.166
Section 32 is expenditure initiation

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.083
and commitment authority,

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:42.458
and section 34 is certification authority.

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:45.375
Section 32 would allow you to order

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.166
office supplies, while section 34

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.625
would allow you to sign off on having received the supplies.

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:56.917
Then there’s section 33, which allows the Finance unit to pay for the supplies.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.959
In certain situations, for example, temporary help services,

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.709
you will need to go through a procurement process

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.208
because it involves a contract.

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:11.583
These situations are governed by section 41 of the FAA,

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.000
and would typically be managed by

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.375
the Procurement section in your organization.

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:19.417
To know what and how much you can authorize,

00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:21.792
consult your own signed delegation card

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:24.875
and your organization’s delegation chart.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.250
Again, the format of these documents will differ,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.417
depending on where you work.

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:37.000
You have the money and you have the delegation. Great!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.709
Now you need to determine the best way to

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.375
get the goods and services in question.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.500
The next activity will give you a chance

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.041
to learn about spending mechanisms!

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.917
Once you’ve checked that you have enough money to cover a purchase,

00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:58.333
you then create either a soft commitment or a hard commitment.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.458
A soft commitment is when you reserve funds

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:02.959
before the supplier is identified.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.083
A hard commitment is when you make an arrangement

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.250
with a known supplier.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.625
Either way, you will need to enter these commitments in the

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:15.875
financial system using the department’s unique financial coding.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.041
This financial coding is a system

00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:21.875
that allows us to keep track of the different kinds of transactions

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:23.333
throughout the year.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:26.333
It allows us to identify, among other things:

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:30.291
which manager is responsible for the financial transaction,

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:32.959
which component of your budget is being used,

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.875
operating and maintenance, salary, etc.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:40.125
The nature of the financial transaction, like if its revenue,

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:43.375
an expenditure, an asset, or a liability.

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:46.542
Details of the transaction,

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:50.208
and the activity to which the financial transaction is linked.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.750
The financial coding system allows you to better manage

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.000
your financial transactions

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.166
and speak to your budget at any moment throughout the year.

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:04.667
Managers often work with administrative professionals

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.417
or financial officers for this task.

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:13.917
To wrap up this section,

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:16.333
let’s take a look at a practice scenario.
