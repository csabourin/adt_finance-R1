00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.617
The purpose of a work plan. A work plan

00:00:03.617 --> 00:00:07.080
is a living document in which you define

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.855
and prioritize your unit activities

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.630
think of it as a to-do list for the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.685
upcoming year it helps communicate how

00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:18.740
you assign resources and set timelines

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.780
it is the cornerstone of your planning

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.900
process because it supports your budget

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.711
and reporting activities typically you

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.449
wouldn't start from scratch you would

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.030
simply review last year's work plan

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.610
budget and report and identify what

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.670
needs to be kept added or removed the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.399
next year but even before putting

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.519
together your work plan it's useful to

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.750
step out of your role and to look at the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.594
big picture

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:48.360
It all starts with the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.120
speech from the throne which outlines

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.992
government priorities these priorities

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:56.940
will trickle down all the way to you as

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.428
a manager and will need to be reflected

00:00:59.428 --> 00:01:01.980
in your work plan let's look at how that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.011
happens after the speech from the throne

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.890
the Prime Minister addresses a mandate

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.233
letter to each departments Minister in

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:14.400
it the Prime Minister sets out their

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.121
overall expectations and policy

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:20.280
objectives for each department every

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.742
year there is a federal budget which

00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:25.409
sets the economic agenda for Canada for

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.509
the year departments will have

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.030
priorities and objectives which will

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.633
align to this agenda in addition to

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:35.460
other core mandates the organization's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.670
objectives are outline and a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.590
departmental results framework or DRF

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.976
the DRF is very high-level broke into

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:47.270
strategic outcomes then you have the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.434
departmental plan which describes the

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:52.230
core responsibilities

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.546
apartment the results the department

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:57.120
wants to achieve and lead indicators for

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.285
these results the departmental plan is

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:05.450
then broken down into plans per sector

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.797
branch and directorate this is where

00:02:08.797 --> 00:02:12.330
your work plan comes in you build your

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.963
work plan around the activities for

00:02:13.963 --> 00:02:15.690
which you are responsible within your

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.962
unit and this naturally ties back to the

00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:23.700
departmental plan at this point you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.500
might be wondering what a work plan

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.460
looks like not all units use the same

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.582
model by talking to colleagues you can

00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:33.480
find out which one is used in your

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.342
office here is a typical work plan

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:39.540
structure have a look also look in the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.826
file section on the top right to find

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:46.290
work plan examples to build a work plan

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.981
it helps to understand the historical

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:51.600
and cultural context of your unit by

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.034
asking yourself a series of questions

00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:58.560
this is what we call the 360 scan here

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.472
is a fictional example of last year's

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:04.620
work plan budget and report try to apply

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.821
the questions in the 360 scan document

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:11.190
to this fictional example you may access

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.913
the 360 stand document at any time from

00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:18.540
the file icon at the top right at this

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.501
point you understand the context both

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.620
historically and culturally and are in a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.385
position to craft this year's work plan

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.080
let's continue to build on the fishing

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.816
licenses scenario imagine that your

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:33.630
director shares with you this coming

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.038
years priorities for your Directorate

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:40.170
protect aquatic ecosystems sustain

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.690
fisheries and manage the issuing of life

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.210
to help you wrap your mind around how to

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.380
fill the other sections of the work plan

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.170
let's continue with the fisheries

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.880
scenario looking at your draft you

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.750
notice that some items may have been

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.180
dropped in the wrong location

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.660
or may be missing

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.500
update your draft accordingly

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.140
all right

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.150
your director tells you that they have

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.912
been to a steering committee and now

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:08.870
they have new information that should be

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.483
reflected in your work plan three things

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:13.293
new software implementation

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:14.030
to speed up the issuing of licenses

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.748
new policy that

00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:20.330
now requires licenses to be issued in 15

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.935
days in all 30 days starting November

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:25.400
1st and a decision not to replace a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.248
retiring employee the following exercise

00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:30.740
will help you adjust your work plan

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.600
according to this new information let's

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.460
take what you've learned into real life

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.156
your organization will have their own

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:41.780
ways of doing things take a time out

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.401
from this course to scan your intranet

00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:47.090
to see which templates are used connect

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.202
with your colleagues your director your

00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:51.260
financial officer to have a chat about

work life so now that you know how to

00:04:54.368 --> 00:04:57.560
examine prepare and adjust a work plan

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.203
let's see what you remember

00:05:00.203 --> 00:05:02.650
by taking this short quiz
