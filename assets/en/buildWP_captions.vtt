00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.045
In this section you will learn to

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:10.170
interpret a work plan, make a 360 degree

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.998
scan, incorporate government priorities

00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:15.900
into a work plan and adjust a work plan

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.382
according to new information this

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:21.390
section should take you approximately 20

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.321
minutes to complete a work plan is a

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:29.580
living document in which you define and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.845
prioritize your units activities think

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.110
of it as a to-do list for the upcoming

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.239
year it helps you to communicate how

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.190
you'll be assigning resources and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.036
managing timelines it's the cornerstone

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:43.590
of your planning process because it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.909
supports your budget and reporting

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.570
activities typically you wouldn't start

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.815
from scratch you would simply review

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:53.309
last year's work plan budget and reports

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.007
to identify what needs to be kept added

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.420
or removed for the new year but even

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.495
before putting together your work plan

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.680
it's useful to step out of your role and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.745
look at the big picture it all starts

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:12.810
with the speech from the throne which

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.169
outlines government priorities these

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:17.790
priorities will cascade down to you as a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.430
manager and will need to be reflected in

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.070
your work plan after the speech from the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.149
throne the Prime Minister addresses a

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.060
mandate letter to each departments

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.894
minister in it the Prime Minister sets

00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:32.430
out their overall expectations and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.533
policy objectives every year there is a

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:40.110
federal budget which sets Canada's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.147
economic agenda for the year

00:01:42.147 --> 00:01:45.930
departments will have priorities and objectives that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.159
align to this agenda in addition to

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.579
other core mandates the organization's

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.199
core responsibilities results results

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:55.890
indicators and programme inventory are

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.650
outlined in a departmental results

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.409
framework or DRF then there is the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.247
departmental plan which outlines

00:02:03.247 --> 00:02:05.430
amongst
other things an organisation's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.748
expenditure plan for the coming year

00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:10.260
it includes in more detail the elements

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.449
of the DRF expected results and

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.850
associated resourcing requirements

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.861
covering a three year period then you

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:20.790
may have plans per sector branch and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.805
Directorate this is where your work plan

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:26.820
comes in you build your work plan around

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.365
the activities that are the

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:30.540
responsibilities of your unit and this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.400
naturally ties back to the departmental

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.260
plan and DRF at this point you might be

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.896
wondering what a work plan looks like

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.390
not all units use the same model by

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.314
talking to your colleagues and to folks

00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:49.140
in corporate planning and Finance you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.886
can find out which one is used in your

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:54.270
office here's a typical work plan

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.835
structure have a look also look in the

00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:59.400
Files section on the top right to find

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.656
work plan examples take a moment now

00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:04.350
to explore the different sections of a work

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.716
plan to build a work plan it helps to

00:03:08.716 --> 00:03:13.200
understand the historical and cultural

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.110
context of your unit by asking yourself

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.870
a series of questions this is what we

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.832
call the 360 scan here's a typical

00:03:21.832 --> 00:03:25.230
example of last year's work plan try to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.049
apply the questions in the 360 scan

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.110
document to this fictional example you

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.128
may access the 360 scan document at

00:03:33.128 --> 00:03:35.550
any time from the Files section of the top

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.050
right.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.407
At this point you should understand the

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:43.200
context both historically

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.568
and culturally and be in a position to

00:03:45.568 --> 00:03:48.060
craft this year's work plan imagine that

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.822
your director shares with you this

00:03:49.822 --> 00:03:51.480
coming years priorities for your

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.505
Directorate protect aquatic ecosystems

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:57.690
sustain fisheries and manage the issuing

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.268
of licenses using the drop-down menu

00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:03.060
choose the best option for each section

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.410
of this work plan

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.480
to help you wrap your mind around how to

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.810
fill the other sections of the work plan

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.044
let's continue with the same scenario

00:04:14.044 --> 00:04:16.459
looking at your Draft you'll notice that

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.916
some items have been dropped into the

00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:21.440
wrong location or maybe missing update

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.570
your draft accordingly.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.830
All right your director tells you that they've

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.722
been to a steering committee meeting and

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:34.520
that they now have three new pieces of

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.938
information that should be reflected in

00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:39.170
your work plan one there will be new

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.264
software implementation to speed up the

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:45.200
issuing of licenses two there's a new

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.032
policy that now requires licenses to be

00:04:48.032 --> 00:04:50.500
issued in fifteen days not 30 days

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.220
starting on November 1st and three

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.420
there's been a decision to not replace a

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.505
retiring employee let's take what you've

00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:06.590
learned into real life your organization

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.896
will have their own ways of doing things

00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:11.030
take a timeout now from the course to

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.218
scan your intranet and see which

00:05:13.218 --> 00:05:15.680
templates are used connect with your

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.810
colleagues your director your financial

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.940
officer to have a chat about work plans

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.245
so now that you know how to examine

00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:28.130
prepare and adjust a work plan let's see

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.260
what you remember by taking this short quiz
