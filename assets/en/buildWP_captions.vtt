00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:08.666
In this section you will learn to interpret a work plan;

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.133
make a 360° scan;

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.666
incorporate government priorities into a work plan;

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:18.333
and adjust a work plan according to new information.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:22.633
This section should take you approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.300
A work plan is a living document

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.166
in which you define and prioritize your unit’s activities.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.666
Think of it as a to-do list for the upcoming year.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:38.200
It helps you to communicate how you’ll be assigning resources

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
and managing timelines.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.533
It’s the cornerstone of your planning process because

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.066
it supports your budget and reporting activities.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.833
Typically, you wouldn’t start from scratch.

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:53.966
You would simply review last year's work plan, budget and reports

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.533
to identify what needs to be kept,

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.633
added

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.066
or removed for the new year.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.566
But even before putting together your work plan,

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:06.699
it’s useful to step out of your role and look at the big picture.

00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.766
It all starts with the Speech from the Throne,

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.066
which outlines government priorities.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.633
These priorities will cascade down to you as a manager,

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.833
and will need to be reflected in your work plan.

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:23.500
After the Speech from the Throne,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.033
the Prime Minister addresses a mandate letter

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.433
to each department’s minister.

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:32.333
In it, the Prime Minister sets out their overall expectations

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.699
and policy objectives.

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.933
Every year, there is a federal budget,

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:42.633
which sets Canada’s economic agenda for the year.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.633
Departments will have priorities and objectives

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:49.666
that align to this agenda in addition to other core mandates.

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:52.966
The organization’s core responsibilities, results,

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:55.533
results indicators, and program inventory

00:01:55.533 --> 00:02:00.633
are outlined in a Departmental Results Framework or “DRF”.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:04.366
Then there is the Departmental Plan, which outlines, amongst other things,

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:08.200
an organization’s expenditure plans for the coming year.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.433
It includes in more detail the elements of the DRF,

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:15.000
expected results, and associated resourcing requirements,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.766
covering a three-year period.

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:22.000
Then you may have plans per sector, branch, and directorate.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.866
This is where your work plan comes in!

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.433
You build your work plan

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:30.033
around the activities that are the responsibility of your unit

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:34.433
and this naturally ties back to the Departmental Plan and DRF.

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:42.566
At this point, you might be wondering what a work plan looks like.

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:45.133
Not all units use the same model.

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:49.133
By talking to your colleagues and to folks in corporate planning and finance,

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:52.833
you can find out which one is used in your office.

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.933
Here is a typical work plan structure. Have a look!

00:02:55.933 --> 00:03:01.333
Also, look in the file section on the top right to find work plan examples.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:05.300
Take a moment now to explore the different sections of a work plan.

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:12.666
To build a work plan, it helps to understand the historical

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:17.666
and cultural context of your unit by asking yourself a series of questions.

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:21.699
This is what we call the 360° Scan.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.833
Here’s a typical example of last year’s work plan.

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:28.666
Try to apply the questions in the 360° Scan document

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.833
to this fictional example.

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:34.133
You may access the 360° Scan document at any time

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:36.208
from the File section on the top right.

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:43.466
At this point, you should understand the context, both historically

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:47.300
and culturally, and be in a position to craft this year’s work plan!

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.466
Imagine that your director shares with you

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:52.633
this coming year’s priorities for your directorate:

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:55.133
protect aquatic ecosystems,

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:59.500
sustain fisheries and manage the issuing of licences.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.966
Using the dropdown menu,

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:04.800
choose the best option for each section of this work plan.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.866
To help you wrap your mind around how to fill the other sections

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:14.533
of the work plan, let’s continue with the same scenario.

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:15.666
Looking at your draft,

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:19.333
you’ll notice that some items have been dropped into the wrong location

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.933
or may be missing.

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:23.433
Update your draft accordingly.

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:29.333
Alright.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:32.566
Your director tells you that they’ve been to a steering committee meeting

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:35.266
and that they now have 3 new pieces of information

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:38.000
that should be reflected in your work plan:

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.699
1) there will be new software implementation

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.066
to speed up the issuing of licences

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:49.533
2) there’s a new policy that now requires licences to be issued in 15 days,

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:53.000
not 30 days, starting on November first;

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.366
and 3) there’s been a decision to not replace a retiring employee.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.433
Let’s take what you've learned into real life.

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:08.933
Your organization will have their own ways of doing things.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:12.766
Take a time out now from the course to scan your intranet

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:14.933
and see which templates are used.

00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:18.300
Connect with your colleagues, your director, your financial officer

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.833
to have a chat about work plans.

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:25.533
So now that you know how to examine,

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.666
prepare, and adjust a work plan,

00:05:27.666 --> 00:05:31.300
let’s see what you remember by taking this short quiz.
