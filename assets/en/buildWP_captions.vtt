00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.667
In this section you will learn to interpret a work plan;

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.125
Make a 360 degree scan;

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:14.667
Incorporate government priorities into a work plan;

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:18.333
And adjust a work plan according to new information.

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:22.625
This section should take you approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.291
A work plan is a living document

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.166
in which you define and prioritize your unit’s activities.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.667
Think of it as a to-do list for the upcoming year.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.208
It helps you to communicate how you’ll be assigning resources

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:40.208
and managing timelines.

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:43.542
It’s the cornerstone of your planning process because

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:47.083
it supports your budget and reporting activities.

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.834
Typically, you wouldn’t start from scratch.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:53.959
You would simply review last year's work plan, budget and reports

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:56.542
to identify what needs to be kept,

00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:57.625
added

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.083
or removed for the new year.

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:02.583
But even before putting together your work plan,

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:06.709
it’s useful to step out of your role and look at the big picture.

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:12.750
It all starts with the Speech from the Throne,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.083
which outlines government priorities.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.625
These priorities will cascade down to you as a manager,

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.834
and will need to be reflected in your work plan.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.500
After the Speech from the Throne,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.041
the Prime Minister addresses a mandate letter

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.417
to each department’s minister.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:32.333
In it, the Prime Minister sets out their overall expectations

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.709
and policy objectives.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.917
Every year, there is a federal budget,

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:42.625
which sets Canada’s economic agenda for the year.

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:45.625
Departments will have priorities and objectives

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:49.667
that align to this agenda in addition to other core mandates.

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.959
The organization’s core responsibilities, results,

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.542
results indicators, and program inventory

00:01:55.542 --> 00:02:00.625
are outlined in a Departmental Results Framework – or “DRF”.

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:04.375
Then there is the Departmental Plan, which outlines, amongst other things,

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:08.208
an organization’s expenditure plans for the coming year.

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:11.417
It includes in more detail the elements of the DRF,

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:15.001
expected results, and associated resourcing requirements,

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.750
covering a three-year period.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.000
Then you may have plans per sector, branch, and directorate.

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.875
This is where your work plan comes in!

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.417
You build your work plan

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:30.041
around the activities that are the responsibility of your unit

00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:34.417
and this naturally ties back into the Departmental Plan and DRF.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.583
At this point, you might be wondering what a work plan looks like.

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:45.125
Not all units use the same model.

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:49.125
By talking to your colleagues and to folks in corporate planning and finance,

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:52.834
you can find out which one is used in your office.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.917
Here is a typical work plan structure. Have a look!

00:02:55.917 --> 00:03:01.333
 Also, look in the Files section on the top right to find work plan examples.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:05.291
Take a moment now to explore the different sections of a work plan.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:12.667
To build a work plan, it helps to understand the historical

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:17.667
and cultural context of your unit by asking yourself a series of questions.

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:21.709
This is what we call the 360 Scan.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.834
Here’s a typical example of last year’s work plan.

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:28.667
Try to apply the questions in the 360 Scan document

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.834
to this fictional example.

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:34.125
You may access the 360 Scan document at any time

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:36.208
from the File icon on the top right.

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.458
At this point, you should understand the context, both historically

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:47.291
and culturally, and be in a position to craft this year’s work plan!

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.458
Imagine that your director shares with you

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:52.625
this coming year’s priorities for your directorate:

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.125
protect aquatic ecosystems,

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:59.500
sustain fisheries and manage the issuing of licenses.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.959
Using the dropdown menus,

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.792
choose the best option for each section of this work plan.

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:10.875
To help you wrap your mind around how to fill out the other sections

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:14.542
of the work plan, let’s continue with the same scenario.

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:15.667
Looking at your draft,

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:19.333
you’ll notice that some items may have been dropped into the wrong location

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.917
or may be missing.

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:23.417
Update your draft accordingly.

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:29.333
Alright.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:32.583
Your director tells you that they’ve been to a steering committee meeting

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:35.250
and that they now have three new pieces of information

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.000
that should be reflected in your work plan:

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.709
1) there will be new software implementation

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:44.083
to speed up the issuing of licenses;

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:49.542
2) there’s a new policy that now requires licenses to be issued in 15 days,

00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:53.001
not 30 days, starting on November 1st;

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:58.375
and 3) there’s been a decision not to replace a retiring employee.

00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.417
Let’s take what you have learned into real life.

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:08.917
Your organization will have their own ways of doing things.

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:12.750
Take a time out from the course to scan your intranet

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.917
and see which templates are used.

00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:18.291
Connect with your colleagues, your director, your financial officer

00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:20.834
to have a chat about work plans.

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:25.542
So now that you know how to examine,

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:27.667
prepare, and adjust a work plan,

00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:31.291
let’s see what you remember by taking this short quiz.
