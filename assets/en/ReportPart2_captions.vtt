00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.417
The Government of Canada regularly publishes reports

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:16.417
to keep Canadians informed on its spending and on the results it achieves

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:18.083
using public funds.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:19.792
As a manager,

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:24.208
it's unlikely that you will be required to write these reports yourself.

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:27.750
However, the work you do may be included in these reports.

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:30.458
For example, you may be asked to report on how well your

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:33.208
programs achieved their intended results.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.041
As such, you must continuously track your performance

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:40.375
and results and compare them with what was planned.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.625
Let’s do a quick activity to get more familiar with the terminology!

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.125
Fiscal year-end is when reporting closes

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.917
the loop on work plans within the organization,

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:57.041
and when we present globally,

00:00:57.041 --> 00:01:00.417
the results we achieved in the Departmental Results Report.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.125
As the fiscal year is a cycle,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:07.500
last year’s results will inform planning for the next fiscal year.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.709
You need to demonstrate how your performance compares with

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:13.917
what you set out in your work plan,

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:16.333
and explain any variances.

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.709
In most departments, your Planning or Finance section

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.333
will reach out to you to request this information.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.959
Demonstrating your performance

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.583
means showing whether you met the indicators as set out in the PIPs,

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.375
the performance information profiles.

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:37.166
These identify more concretely each program’s core responsibility

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.709
and results to be achieved.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.458
Some departments review performance information profiles

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:46.333
throughout the year to see if targets are on track

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.625
or at risk of not being achieved.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:53.375
In the next activity, you will have the opportunity to practise reporting

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:55.625
on whether your targets were met.

00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:03.417
Let’s take what you have learned into real life.

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:07.250
Look up your organization’s performance information profiles

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.583
and its external reports, such as the Departmental Results Report.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.542
Your organization will have their own ways

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:16.959
of doing financial situation reports,

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.417
and reporting on spending and results.

00:02:20.417 --> 00:02:22.875
Talk to your Finance or Planning section

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.709
and your director.

00:02:24.917 --> 00:02:26.125
Ask them:

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:30.500
What do we call our financial situation reports, and what do they look like?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.291
Where can I find them?

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:35.542
How frequently do we prepare them?

00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:39.792
Do we complete these reports in the financial system or in a spreadsheet?

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.583
What is my role?

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:45.834
And, what information will I provide to feed into external reports?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.125
Let’s try this quiz to see what you remember

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:55.375
 from the Report section.
