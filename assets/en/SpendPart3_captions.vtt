00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:11.417
As a manager, you are responsible for

00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:14.375
ensuring that all commitments and expenditures

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:16.208
are monitored throughout the year

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:20.000
and that they are accurately recorded in the financial system.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.917
This monitoring is both at a transactional level and at a strategic level.

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:28.291
Depending on the situation,

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.417
it may involve one or more of the following actions:

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.083
Closing commitments that are no longer required.

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:39.458
Amending contracts for scope, time, and amount.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.417
Updating the salary forecast to reflect your current and planned staffing needs.

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:50.000
Planning for potential budget shortfalls or pressures.

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:54.959
Flagging budget surpluses to senior management.

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:57.667
And making expenditure adjustments.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.166
Let’s play with a few examples.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:07.625
Taking care of your budget is really important

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:10.333
because the decisions you make within your budget

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.875
may influence your sector, your branch,

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.375
or even your department.

00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:16.750
At the end of the fiscal year,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.000
you will need to justify any deficits or surpluses.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.333
Depending on your department,

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:27.291
you may need to be within a certain percentage of your forecasts.

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:30.458
On the one hand, overspending can cause a deficit,

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:32.834
which puts a lot of pressure on senior management

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:36.709
to find additional sources of funds to compensate.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.792
On the other hand, a surplus should be flagged as early as possible

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:44.166
so that your unit doesn’t miss an opportunity to reallocate

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.500
unused funds to another activity,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.000
or another unit.

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.709
Monthly reports help you track your financials.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.250
They are sometimes called “financial situation reports”

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.542
or FSRs and are usually produced by the Finance team within your organization.

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:05.750
What is in the FSR needs to match what is actually going on in your unit.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.667
If it doesn’t, then you need to take appropriate action

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.208
to resolve the discrepancy.

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:14.417
In the next activity, you will have a chance to review

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:18.750
and adjust your financial situation according to new information.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.542
Since most budgets are allocated by Parliament on

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:28.959
an annual basis and must be used within the fiscal year,

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.125
goods and services must be received on or before March 31.

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:38.083
However, you will most likely have a number of outstanding expenditures

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:41.291
that you will not be able to pay before the end of the fiscal year

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.250
for goods that are in your possession.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.333
To help with that, the Finance unit will establish

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:52.083
Payables at Year-End or Receivables at Year-End in the financial system

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:55.625
after receiving your list of outstanding payables.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.917
A P-A-Y-E is an amount owed for

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.125
goods and/or services

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.583
delivered in the old fiscal year

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:07.000
using old year funds

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.458
but paid in the new fiscal year

00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:12.166
when the supplier invoice is received.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:17.917
An R-A-Y-E is an amount due from another department

00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:19.750
for goods and/or services

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.417
delivered in the old fiscal year,

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:26.709
for which receipt of payment will be in the new fiscal year.

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.792
Usually, again depending on the practices

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.500
within your department—

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.542
Finance will send out year-end instructions

00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:40.458
about how to establish a P-A-Y-E or an R-A-Y-E.

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:44.250
These instructions will also include specific requirements

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.667
with respect to the minimum dollar amount and the timeline.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.250
Contracts can be a bit tricky when we are close to

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.500
the end of the fiscal year.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.041
Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:02.291
One, pay attention to the deadlines set by Procurement.

00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:06.709
You may not be able to create a purchase order as you approach year-end.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:10.375
Two, follow with suppliers to make sure that the goods

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.208
or services will be delivered before year-end.

00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:16.083
If it's not possible before March 31,

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:20.208
the expenditures will have to be paid using new year funding.

00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:23.208
Talk to Procurement about possible steps.

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:31.291
So now that you know how to initiate expenditures,

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:32.917
authorize commitments,

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:37.000
exercise financial authority and monitor and control finances,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.041
let’s see what you remember by taking this short quiz.
