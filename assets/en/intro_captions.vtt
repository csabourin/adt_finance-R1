00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.300
Welcome! You're in the right place if

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.029
you're a manager looking to learn about

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.279
how to make responsible use of public

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.160
funds for planning spending and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.200
reporting there are many reasons why

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.930
managers like you might take this course

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.400
I'm new to financial delegation and I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.390
need to learn everything there is to

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.650
know about my financial responsibilities

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.270
I've been a manager for most of my

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.100
career but I'm new to government

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.239
I want to leverage my experience by

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.440
connecting what I already know about

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.730
finance to the realm of government I

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.830
just came back from my parental leave

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.900
and I could really use a refresher on my

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.260
financial responsibilities and what

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.900
might have changed since I left I'm an

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.850
experienced manager in government as per

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.830
the policy I need to recertify every

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
five years in order to continue

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.940
exercising my financial delegation I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.549
really just want to get to the test

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.130
please whatever brought you here you're

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.110
in charge of your own learning think of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.360
this as a choose-your-own-adventure kind

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.710
of experience and take what you need to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.939
succeed if all you need is to take the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
test because you're already pretty

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.049
familiar with the content then by all

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.450
means start with that if you just need

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.820
an overview or a refresher then simply

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.759
review the intro sections of each phase

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.350
to get the key highlights and tools

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.149
you'll also want to make use of the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.579
handy features on your screen like this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.039

job if you're learning this for the

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.359
first time then take the time to go

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.670
through each section do the in-depth

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.640
learning activities and review the tools
