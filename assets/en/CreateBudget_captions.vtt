00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.500
In this lesson you will learn how to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.650
create a budget that is in line with

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.150
your work plan. People who have been

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.359
doing this for a while will tell you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.361
that these two things the work plan and

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.260
the budget are often done at the same

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.774
time in a single step however in order

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:36.090
to help you learn how to do each of

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.150
these tasks well we separated them

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.480
creating a budget involves three main

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750
tasks analyzing the available

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.489
information forecasting your budget

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.782
requirements and submitting your

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:52.649
proposed budget analyzing means taking a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.329
good look at last year's work plan and

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.079
financial reports if you have access to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.625
prior years it's a good idea to look at

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.170
those as well as the current financials

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.020
contacts and priorities of your

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510
organization

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.391
forecasting means estimating costs and

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:14.040
identifying those costs that may change

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.780
significantly over the fiscal year once

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.380
your budget requirements are complete

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.410
you submit your proposed budget you may

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.439
be asked to make adjustments before the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.680
final approval ready to dive into each

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920
of these steps great just before we do

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.170
that though let's take a moment to learn

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.420
about how the government financial cycle

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.584
works so that you can tie it in with

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:41.869
your own work as a manager

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.093
let's look at how you create your budget

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:52.390
requirements in the larger context of

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.122
the financial cycle of the government of

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:57.580
canada the fiscal year of government

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.428
runs from April to March 31st as you can

00:02:00.428 --> 00:02:02.920
see some activities are both at the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.212
government-wide level and organizational

00:02:06.212 --> 00:02:09.340
level key activities happen to prepare

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.745
for the next fiscal year

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:12.970
others are happening during the fiscal

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.390
year and others occur after it is over

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.810
as a manager you're building your work

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.276
plan and budget requirements for the

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:24.880
next fiscal year in the fall you could

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.204
be responsible for a new program being

00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:29.650
established through a budget proposal or

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.564
a memorandum to cabinet these are

00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:35.920
discussed at the Finance Committee pre

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.337
budget consultations when the new

00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:40.900
program is announced in the federal

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.368
budget you would then need to prepare a

00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:45.519
Treasury Board submission and seek

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.540
approval to access the funding interim

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.560
supply provides the initial funding to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.582
kick off the year while waiting for

00:02:55.582 --> 00:02:57.720
Parliament to approve the full supply

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.972
now where do you fit in your work plan

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.540
feeds into your organization's

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.403
departmental plan and your budget rolls

00:03:06.403 --> 00:03:09.340
up into the main estimates which present

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.387
the resources required by each

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:14.049
organization to fulfill its mandate and

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.497
cover its priorities for the coming year

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.859
full supply based on the main estimates

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.761
is approved around the end of June from

00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:26.440
the moment that full supply has been

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.151
approved starting budgets are

00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:32.890
officialized for each department budgets

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.077
are formalized into departmental

00:03:35.077 --> 00:03:37.810
financial systems and business plans are

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.979
reflected in the performance agreements

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.230
of managers and employees Parliament can

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.772
grant additional spending powers during

00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:49.380
the year through supplementary estimates

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.117
they may have an impact on your

00:03:52.117 --> 00:03:55.560
department which may affect your budget

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.472
you will spend the money in your budget

00:03:58.472 --> 00:03:59.890
throughout the year

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.057
this eventually makes its way at high

00:04:03.057 --> 00:04:06.480
level into the public accounts of Canada

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.375
towards the end of the year you are

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.540
asked for information on the results you

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.083
achieved on the activities in your work

00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:15.040
plan this becomes part of your

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.020
organization's departmental results

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.829

precise forecasts will increase with

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:01.419
experience you got this the following

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.324

can move that amount over from salary

00:06:56.317 --> 00:06:58.780
though not common you can convert some

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.649
funds from salary to onm or vice versa

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:06.009
you just need to factor in the 27

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.177
percent employee benefit plan EBP in

00:07:10.177 --> 00:07:14.229
your calculations this means that a

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:16.193
hundred thousand dollars in salary

00:07:16.193 --> 00:07:18.099
equals a hundred and twenty seven

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:22.011
thousand dollars in onm it's the reverse

00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:25.629
converting salary to onm talk to your

may need some other sources of funds in

00:07:33.712 --> 00:07:35.770
your budget to cover the priorities in

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.098
your work plan here are a few examples

00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:42.250

within your own budget get extra money

00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:48.009
from other managers use an untapped

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.524
surplus your director might have

00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:52.960
Treasury Board submissions or a

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.811

would otherwise not be able to undertake

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:16.383
or that is outside its delegated

00:08:16.383 --> 00:08:19.900

00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:52.230
departments can transfer incurred costs

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.981
between one another or collect revenue

00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:57.560
