00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.583
In this lesson,

00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:09.458
you will learn how to create a budget that aligns with your work plan.

00:00:09.458 --> 00:00:11.166
People who have been doing this for a while will tell

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.500
you that these 2 things — the work plan and the budget —

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.375
are often done at the same time in a single step.

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:21.750
However, in order to help you learn how to do each of these tasks well,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.709
we’ve separated them.

00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:26.917
Creating a budget involves 3 main tasks:

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.709
analyzing the available information,

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:32.208
forecasting the budget requirements,

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:34.500
and submitting your proposed budget.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.875
Analyzing means taking a good look at

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.834
last year’s work plan and financial reports.

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:50.750
If you have access to previous years,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.959
it’s a good idea to look at those,

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:56.500
as well as the current financials, new initiatives,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.917
context and priorities for your organization.

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:02.375
Forecasting means estimating costs

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:07.250
and identifying costs that may change significantly over the fiscal year.

00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:10.959
Once your budget requirements are complete,

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.208
submit your proposed budget to upper management.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:17.709
It will then be moved up to the departmental level.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.792
You may be asked to make adjustments before final approval.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.041
Ready to dive further into each of these steps?

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:28.417
Great! Just before we do that, though, let’s take a moment

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:31.250
to learn how the government financial cycle works,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.667
so that you can tie it in with your own work as a manager.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:43.083
Let’s look at how you create your budget requirements

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:47.792
in the larger context of the financial cycle of the Government of Canada.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:54.542
The government fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31.

00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:58.625
Some activities exist at both the government-wide level

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.166
and at the organizational level.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:05.625
Key activities happen in preparation for the next fiscal year,

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.875
others happen during the fiscal year,

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:11.291
and other activities occur after the year has ended.

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:16.875
As a manager, you’re building your work plan and budget requirements

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.041
for the next fiscal year in the fall.

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:23.041
You could be responsible for a new program being established through

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:24.375
a budget proposal

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.542
or a memorandum to Cabinet.

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:28.875
These are discussed in the financial committee

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.291
pre-budget consultations.

00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:35.375
When the new program is announced in the federal budget,

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:39.041
you would then need to prepare a Treasury Board submission,

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:41.792
and seek approval to access the funding.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.709
To start off the fiscal year, there’s an interim supply,

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.458
which provides the initial funding to kick off the year.

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:52.750
This is usually three-twelfths of your budget.

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:57.208
You’ll get this while waiting for Parliament to approve the full supply.

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:00.083
Now where do you fit in?

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:05.001
Your work plan feeds into your organization’s Departmental Plan.

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.083
And your budget moves up into the main estimates,

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:11.625
which present the resources allocated to each organization

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.583
to fulfill its mandate and cover its priorities

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:16.417
for the coming fiscal year.

00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:19.375
Full supply is based on the main estimates

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:22.166
and gets approved around the end of June.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:24.792
From the moment full supply has been approved,

00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:28.375
starting budgets are made official for each department.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:32.542
Budgets are formalized into departmental financial systems,

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:36.166
and business plans are reflected in the performance agreements

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:38.667
of managers and employees.

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:43.542
Parliament can grant additional spending powers during the year,

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:46.208
through supplementary estimates.

00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:48.250
They have an impact on your department,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.125
which may affect your budget.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.917
You spend the money in your budget throughout the year.

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:56.792
This eventually makes its way, at a higher level,

00:03:56.792 --> 00:03:59.041
into the Public Accounts of Canada.

00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.583
Towards the end of the year,

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.792
you will be asked for information on the results you achieved

00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:07.166
on the activities in your work plan.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:11.625
This becomes part of your organization's Departmental Results Report.

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:13.750
And by then,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.959
you will already be starting your work plan and

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.750
budget requirements for the next fiscal year.

00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:27.959
Now that you have a better sense of the financial

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:29.875
cycle of the Government of Canada,

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:32.583
and how it relates to your work as a manager,

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:36.083
let’s go back to our analyze-forecast-submit workflow

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:38.041
to create a budget.

00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:41.959
The more often you do this, the more accurate your budget will be.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:45.542
Don’t worry, your ability to make precise forecasts will

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:48.458
increase with experience. You got this!

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:54.333
In the following activity, you will look at the key terms regarding budgets.

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.500
You’re now familiar with the key terms.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.000
You will have a chance to create your proposed budget

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.583
by using information

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:08.083
from last year and this year.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:11.750
Click on any question marks you see and a question will appear.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.917
Once you’ve answered it,

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:15.667
the correct figure will appear in the budget.

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:22.834
After getting all the information you can from

00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:25.750
last year’s and the current year’s budget,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.667
you find that you still need to forecast some budget requirements.

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.542
Let’s continue creating your proposed budget.

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:36.291
Click on any question marks you see and a question will appear.

00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:40.375
Once you’ve answered it, the correct figure will appear in the budget.

00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:48.917
You’re now ready to submit your budget to your director.

00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:52.208
You may be asked to explain assumptions you made,

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:54.250
how your figures were estimated,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.792
and how your budget will allow you to fulfil your priorities.

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:01.709
Always keep in mind that your expenditures must stay in line

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:04.709
with the departmental mandate and priorities.

00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:08.875
If your director asks about costs,

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:10.959
the budget notes in your “back pocket”

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:13.709
will remind you how you reached them.

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:17.208
You may need to make adjustments before you get final approval.

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:21.625
During the meeting, if your director asks you to adjust your budget,

00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:24.542
you may also need to update your work plan.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.834
You may not have enough budget in O&amp;M but find

00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:31.542
that you could move that amount over from Salary.

00:06:31.542 --> 00:06:32.917
Though not common,

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:36.333
you can convert some funds from Salary to O&amp;M,

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:37.667
or vice versa.

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:39.917
You just need to factor in the

00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:46.083
Employee Benefit Plan — or EBP — amount in your calculations.

00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:50.625
For example, some departments use 27% for the EBP.

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:53.542
This means that $100,000 in Salary

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:57.667
equals $127,000 in O&amp;M.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.000
Or vice versa.

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:02.667
Talk to your financial management advisor

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:05.875
if you think this might be something you need to do.

00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:10.208
You may need other funding sources in your budget to

00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:13.041
cover the priorities in your work plan.

00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:16.291
Here are a few more examples of what you could do:

00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:19.041
Get extra money from other managers,

00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:22.917
use an untapped surplus your director might have.

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:26.166
Depending on the department, some reserves are kept at the DG,

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:28.375
ADM or departmental level.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:33.125
Or, submit a Treasury Board Submission or memorandum to Cabinet.

00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:36.041
A Treasury Board Submission is a document used to seek

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:37.875
Treasury Board approval

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.583
for a program-execution strategy

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:42.792
and/or funding authorities

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:45.458
for an initiative that the organization would otherwise

00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:47.041
not be able to undertake

00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:49.917
or that is outside its delegated authorities.

00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:53.458
For more information, look in the toolbox.

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:55.834
A memorandum to Cabinet

00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:59.667
is used at any time of the year by ministers who wish to consult

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.792
with their ministerial colleagues in Cabinet

00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:05.166
and reach a Cabinet decision.

00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:08.417
For more information, look in the toolbox.

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:12.125
In case you’re wondering what an interdepartmental settlement is,

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:15.542
it refers to a transfer of funds between any two departments

00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:20.208
or agencies that operate within the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.291
Examples are: language testing performed by the

00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:24.917
Public Service Commission,

00:08:24.917 --> 00:08:28.667
or translation by the Translation Bureau within Public Services

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.125
and Procurement Canada.

00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:34.458
In the following activity, you will adjust your proposed budget.

00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:43.250
Let’s bring what you have learned into real life.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.417
Your organization will have their own ways of

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:47.417
responding to budget requirements.

00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:49.625
Take time out from the course

00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:53.750
and talk to your financial management advisor and director.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.208
Ask them the following questions:

00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:58.542
Do we have a budget template?

00:08:58.542 --> 00:09:00.291
What budgets do we have?

00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:04.792
For example, operating budgets, which includes Salary and O&amp;M,

00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:07.417
Grants and Contributions, or Gs&amp;Cs,

00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:09.250
and Capital.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.083
And finally, ask if the capital budget is managed

00:09:12.083 --> 00:09:15.125
centrally or by each manager.

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:24.375
We’re at the end of this lesson on how to create a budget!

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:27.250
Take a few moments to answer the following questions

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.041
to see what you remember!
