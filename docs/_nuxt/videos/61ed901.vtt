00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.080
the purpose of a work plan a work plan

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.160
is a living document in which you define

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.630
and prioritize your unit activities

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.929
think of it as a to-do list for the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.740
upcoming year it helps communicate how

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.960
you assign resources and set timelines

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.900
it is the cornerstone of your planning

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.260
process because it supports your budget

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.449
and reporting activities typically you

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.430
wouldn't start from scratch you would

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.610
simply review last year's work plan

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.820
budget and report and identify what

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.399
needs to be kept added or removed the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.290
next year but even before putting

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.750
together your work plan it's useful to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.170
step out of your role and to look at the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.120
big picture it all starts with this

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.449
speech from the throne which outlines

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.940
government priorities these priorities

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.070
will trickle down all the way to you as

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.980
a manager and will need to be reflected

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.920
in your work plan let's look at how that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.890
happens after the speech from the throne

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.909
the Prime Minister addresses a mandate

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.400
letter to each departments Minister in

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.830
it the Prime Minister sets out their

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.280
overall expectations and policy

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.500
objectives for each department every

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.409
year there is a federal budget which

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.659
sets the economic agenda for Canada for

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.030
the year departments will have

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.520
priorities and objectives which will

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.460
align to this agenda in addition to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.409
other core mandates the organization's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.590
objectives are outline and a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.130
departmental results framework or DRF

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.270
the DRF is very high-level broke into

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.310
strategic outcomes then you have the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.230
departmental plan which describes the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.480
core responsibilities

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.120
apartment the results the department

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.010
wants to achieve and lead indicators for

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:05.450
these results the departmental plan is

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.630
then broken down into plans per sector

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.330
branch and directorate this is where

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.920
your work plan comes in you build your

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.690
work plan around the activities for

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.110
which you are responsible within your

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.700
unit and this naturally ties back to the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.740
departmental plan at this point you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.460
might be wondering what a work plan

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.740
looks like not all units use the same

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.480
model by talking to colleagues you can

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.630
find out which one is used in your

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.540
office here is a typical work plan

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.550
structure have a look also look in the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.290
file section on the top right to find

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.420
work plan examples to build a work plan

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.600
it helps to understand the historical

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.870
and cultural context of your unit by

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.560
asking yourself a series of questions

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.930
this is what we call the 360 scan here

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.620
is a fictional example of last year's

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.130
work plan budget and report try to apply

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.190
the questions in the 360 scan document

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.700
to this fictional example you may access

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.540
the 360 stand document at any time from

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.400
the file icon at the top right at this

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.620
point you understand the context both

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.190
historically and culturally and are in a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.080
position to craft this year's work plan

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.290
let's continue to build on the fishing

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.630
licenses scenario imagine that your

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.680
director shares with you this coming

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.170
years priorities for your Directorate

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.590
protect aquatic ecosystems sustain

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.210
fisheries and manage the issuing of life

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.190
to help you wrap your mind around how to

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.170
fill the other sections of the work plan

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.620
let's continue with the fisheries

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.750
scenario looking at your draft you

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.910
notice that some items may have been

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.660
dropped in the wrong location or may be

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.530
missing

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.150
update your draft accordingly all right

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.130
your director tells you that they have

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.870
been to a steering committee and now

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.240
they have new information that should be

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.030
reflected in your work plan three things

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.959
new software implementation to speed up

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.330
the issuing of licenses new policy that

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.310
now requires licenses to be issued in 15

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.400
days in all 30 days starting November

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.060
1st and a decision not to replace a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.740
retiring employee the following exercise

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.290
take what you've learned into real life

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.780
your organization will have their own

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.240
ways of doing things take a time out

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.090
from this course to scan your intranet

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.890
to see which templates are used connect

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.260
with your colleagues your director your

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.500
