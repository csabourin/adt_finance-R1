00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.700
Welcome! you're in the right place if

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.300
you're a manager looking to learn about

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.497
how to make responsible use of

00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:30.399
public funds,

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.279
for planning, spending and reporting.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.889
There are many reasons why managers

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:37.200
like you might take this course:

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.329
I'm new to financial delegation and I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.400
need to learn everything there is to

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.238
know about my financial responsibilities

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:46.650
I've been a manager for most of my

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.298
career but I'm new to government

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.100
I want to leverage my experience by

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.270
connecting what I already know about

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.440
finance to the realm of government

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.549
I just came back from my parental leave

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.830
and I could really use a refresher on my

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.433
financial responsibilities and what

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.260
might have changed since I left. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.434
I'm an experienced manager in government. 

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:08.850
As per the policy I need to recertify every

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.724
five years in order to continue

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:12.900
exercising my financial delegation. 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.099
I really just want to get to the test please.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:17.549
Whatever brought you here you're

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.801
in charge of your own learning think of

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.110
this as a choose-your-own-adventure kind

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.453
of experience and take what you need to

00:01:25.453 --> 00:01:28.710
succeed if all you need is to take the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.147
test because you're already pretty

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:31.710
familiar with the content then by all

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.080
means start with that if you just need

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.450
an overview or a refresher then simply

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.721
review the intro sections of each phase

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:40.759
to get the key highlights and tools

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.835
you'll also want to make use of the

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:45.149
handy features on your screen like this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.528

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:50.039
tools and resources to help you on the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.515
job if you're learning this for the

00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:54.990
first time then take the time to go

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.207
through each section do the in-depth

00:01:57.207 --> 00:01:59.670
learning activities and review the tools

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.310
and resources we promise it's worth the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.560
effort
